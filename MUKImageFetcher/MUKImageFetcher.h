/**
 An object which coordinates a `MUKObjectCache` instance with a 
 `MUKURLConnectionQueue` instance in order to download and cache a group
 of images (e.g. thumbnails in a table view).
 
 ## Constants
 
 `MUKImageFetcherSearchDomain` enumerates where the fetcher could look for
 image:
 
 * `MUKImageFetcherSearchDomainNone` does not search anywhere.
 * `MUKImageFetcherSearchDomainMemoryCache` searches in memory cache.
 * `MUKImageFetcherSearchDomainFileCache` searches in file cache.
 * `MUKImageFetcherSearchDomainCache` searches in cache (both in memory and 
 in files.
 * `MUKImageFetcherSearchDomainFile` permits to load images from files (in
 provided image URLs are file URLs).
 * `MUKImageFetcherSearchDomainLocal` permits local loading.
 * `MUKImageFetcherSearchDomainRemote` permits downloading from network.
 * `MUKImageFetcherSearchDomainEverywhere` searches for image everywhere, both
 locally and on network.
